# Housing Regression Project


Project Overview - Our real estate company has created a machine learning model to predict the selling prics of houses based on a range of features on which the value of the house is evaluated. 


Objective
Understand which house factors are responsible for a higher property value over $650K and above. 



Approach
1. Import the data 
2. Explore the data using the EDA
The dataset we used consists of information on 22,000 properties and contains historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015. Our first approach consisted of: * Importing the data * Exploring the data (EDA Method) * Data wrangling * Data cleaning * Check for multicolinearity
