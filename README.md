# Housing Regression Project


Project Overview - Our real estate company has created a machine learning model to predict the selling prics of houses based on a range of features on which the value of the house is evaluated. 


Objective
The senior management of the real estate company also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tools. One of those parameters includes understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above. We followed this workflow in Python in order to build the required model:


Approach
The dataset we used consists of information on 22,000 properties and contains historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015. Our first approach consisted of: * Importing the data * Exploring the data (EDA Method) * Data wrangling * Data cleaning * Check for multicolinearity
