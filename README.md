# Housing Regression Project


Project Overview - Our real estate company has created a machine learning model to predict the selling prics of houses based on a range of features on which the value of the house is evaluated. 


Objective
Understand which house factors are responsible for a higher property value over $650K and above. 

What are we looking at:
The dataset used consists of information on 22,000 properties and contains historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015. 



Approach
1. Import the data 
2. Explore the data using EDA
3. Clean the data and check for multicolinearity 
4. Train the model - 3 attempts were done to get the best results
5. Visualise the data using SQL & Tableau


Key findings
98039 is significantly the most expensive  Zip Code, followed by 98004
3 bedroom houses are most popular, followed by 4 bedroom
Prices highly correlated to house grade and amount of living area
Waterfront homes have higher sale prices


SQL
For a deeper understanding of the dataset a series of questions were answered. Follow this link to review:
